## Welsh competitive cheerleading team, first project

#### This is my first project and I am very worried on how this is going to turn out! 

##### This project is for my cheerleading team, it provides extra credibility for the team by having an online presence in website. We also currently pay a website booking service a monthly subscription to book classes but by having our own website to do this we would save money.
